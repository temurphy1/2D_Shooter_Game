# 2D_Shooter_Game
A 2D Shooter Game created using Pygame. Most of the code written by CursorAI. 

The shootergame.py is the main file that holds the game; the .wav files are sound files that the script calls during the game (i.e. sound of the gun, the sound that plays when the player dies, etc. etc.).

Current most serious bug is in collision detection: as of now the player can "walk through" the purple obstacles, which is not ideal. It is also not uncommon to see targets spawn inside of obstacles, which makes the game unplayabale.
